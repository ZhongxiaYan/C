# mini_web_projects

Some Chrome Extensions and static websites that I created at some point to learn more about front-end web development.

## Drawing App

A Chrome Extension drawing pad that had functionalities like lines, arrows, circles / arcs, text / math symbols, polygons, eraser, flood fill, and axes / coordinates. The user can upload and save images, as well as redo and undo any changes made.

I originally made this to create concept illustrations to help out my friends who asked for help.

## Website Block

A Chrome Extension that allows users to block websites that they don't want themselves to visit (e.g. websites that distract from studying). Has timers in case the user wanted to periodically unblock the website so they can visit occasionally. Uses Chrome local storage for storing the user settings.

## Personal Website

My personal attempt at web design of a static personal website (with multiple pages). Has multiple subpages with fully custom everything (e.g. navbar, slider, gallery).
